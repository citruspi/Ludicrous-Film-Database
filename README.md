## Ludicrous Film Database

Ludicrous Film Database is a lightweight film database viewer, allowing users to quickly search for and find films in a clean interface.

## Why?

Every time I need information about a film, I head to the Internet Movie Database. Every time, I'm hit with a lot of irrelevant information and many advertisements. So, I decided to write a cleaner, nicer alternative.

Oh, and I'm a Python web developer for the most part, and I have a dislike of all things JavaScript. To the extent that I don't enable JavaScript in my browser by default. My challenge to myself this project was to write it entirely in JavaScript, no backend code.

I learnt a lot, to say the least.

## Ludicrous?

I named it after the scene in the film Spaceballs where they accelerate to Ludicrous speed because the app will (when it's done) be ludicrously fast... _hopefully_.

## Future Plans

Given the time, I plan to implement searching for people (actors, directors, et al.) and searching for television serials.
